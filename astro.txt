Astronphysics : neutron star how the universe works, season 7 episode 1 2 times the mqss of the sun with a radius of manhattan Contrary to what was thought, heavier element than iron may be produced in them in the atom, the electron are pushed so close from the core that they hit a proton ; this will produce even more neutrons while destroying proton and electron Pasta metaphore : gnochi then spaghetti then lasagna and tortilioni Produced by supernova A pulsar is a type of rapidly speeding neutron star i.e. if the star has angular momentum, its accelerate as in patin artistique surface sometimes go as fast as 20 pourcent the speed of light electric and magnetic fields generate beams of radiation starquake because of magnetism Magnetar, 1 out of 10 neutron star; has an extreme magnetic field magnetar dies away because of their extreme magnetic field pulsar - cosmic light houses use pulsar to triangulate in the universe like gps with satelite; voyager from nasa contains a map to find earth using 14 pulsars all of this come from the humble neutron

supernova how the universe works, season 7 episode 2 to become supernova at least 8 times more massive than our sun massive star; every second fuses 7,5 billion tons of hydrogÃ¨ne, which equals a hundred billion atomics bons per seconds can reach a billion degree enthe center of the star when proton and electron becomes neutron in the neutron core, this release neutrino => supernova produces neutrinos neutrino pressure was one of the missing link explaining supernova decay of radioactive elements prolounge the light emitted by the supernova; sometimes it lasts for months, year one supernova; all dna molecules founds inside one supernova; enough iron for 70 000 earth more energy red or blue light type I supernova hydrogen is missing Type 2 has hydrogen supernova gives gamma ray which leads to mutation. Supernova therefore may drive evolution

Interstellar space; how the universe works; season 7 episode 3
Solar system : eight planets, more than 180 moons 
The sun influence stretches more than one light year in every direction
