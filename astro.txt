Astronphysics : neutron star how the universe works, season 7 episode 1 2 times the mqss of the sun with a radius of manhattan Contrary to what was thought, heavier element than iron may be produced in them in the atom, the electron are pushed so close from the core that they hit a proton ; this will produce even more neutrons while destroying proton and electron Pasta metaphore : gnochi then spaghetti then lasagna and tortilioni Produced by supernova A pulsar is a type of rapidly speeding neutron star i.e. if the star has angular momentum, its accelerate as in patin artistique surface sometimes go as fast as 20 pourcent the speed of light electric and magnetic fields generate beams of radiation starquake because of magnetism Magnetar, 1 out of 10 neutron star; has an extreme magnetic field magnetar dies away because of their extreme magnetic field pulsar - cosmic light houses use pulsar to triangulate in the universe like gps with satelite; voyager from nasa contains a map to find earth using 14 pulsars all of this come from the humble neutron

supernova how the universe works, season 7 episode 2 to become supernova at least 8 times more massive than our sun massive star; every second fuses 7,5 billion tons of hydrogène, which equals a hundred billion atomics bons per seconds can reach a billion degree enthe center of the star when proton and electron becomes neutron in the neutron core, this release neutrino => supernova produces neutrinos neutrino pressure was one of the missing link explaining supernova decay of radioactive elements prolounge the light emitted by the supernova; sometimes it lasts for months, year one supernova; all dna molecules founds inside one supernova; enough iron for 70 000 earth more energy red or blue light type I supernova hydrogen is missing Type 2 has hydrogen supernova gives gamma ray which leads to mutation. Supernova therefore may drive evolution

Interstellar space; how the universe works; season 7 episode 3
Solar system : eight planets, more than 180 moons 
The sun influence stretches more than one light year in every direction
Interstellar space is the region between star systems in our galaxy
ʻOumuamua is the first known interstellar object detected passing through the Solar System. Formally designated 1I/2017 U1, it was discovered by Robert Weryk using the Pan-STARRS telescope at Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, on 19 October 2017, 40 days after it passed its closest point to the Sun on 9 September. When it was first observed, it was about 33 million km (21 million mi; 0.22 AU) from Earth (about 85 times as far away as the Moon), and already heading away from the Sun.
ʻOumuamua is a small object estimated to be between 100 and 1,000 metres 
umuamua is tumbling, rather than smoothly rotating, and is moving so fast relative to the Sun that there is no chance it originated in the Solar System
 It is thought that its surface contains tholins, which are irradiated organic compounds that are more common in objects in the outer Solar System and can help determine the age of the surface.
Some cosmic ray can travel as fast as 99% the speed of light
Sun solar wind and earth magnetic field protect us from cosmis ray
200 hundred billion star in our galaxy
Orc cloud may be disrupted by a star passing nearby
BlackHole at the center of nearly every large galaxy
Could be one rogue planet for every four stars in our galaxy
Because of its gravity pull, if a rogue planet as moons they can be liquid water because of friction; therefore life is theoritically possible
Gas and dust betzeen the star : The interstellar medium, hydrogène and helium mainly, most common stuff in the galaxy
more gaz than elsewhere : Interstellar cloud. Some may reach a million time the mass of the sun; place where star form
Star form when an interstellar cloud collapses
Further is intergalactic space. About a third of the normal matter in the universe is missing compared to the big bang
A quasar (also known as a quasi-stellar object abbreviated QSO) is an extremely luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), in which a supermassive black hole with mass ranging from millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun is surrounded by a gaseous accretion disk. As gas in the disk falls towards the black hole, energy is released in the form of electromagnetic radiation, which can be observed across the electromagnetic spectrum. The power radiated by quasars is enormous: the most powerful quasars have luminosities thousands of times greater than a galaxy such as the Milky Way.[2]
