Astronphysics : neutron star how the universe works, season 7 episode 1
2 times the mqss of the sun  with a radius of manhattan

while destroying proton and electron
Pasta metaphore : gnochi then spaghetti then lasagna and tortilioni
Produced by supernova
A pulsar is a type of rapidly speeding neutron star i.e. if the star has angular momentum, its accelerate as in patin artistique
surface sometimes go as fast as 20 pourcent the speed of light
electric and magnetic fields generate beams of radiation
starquake because of magnetism
Magnetar, 1 out of 10 neutron star; has an extreme magnetic field
magnetar dies away because of their extreme magnetic field
pulsar - cosmic light houses
use pulsar to triangulate in the universe like gps with satelite; voyager from nasa contains a map to find earth using 14 pulsars
all of this come from the humble neutron
